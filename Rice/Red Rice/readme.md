>Red rice is a variety of rice that is colored red by its anthocyanin content. It is usually eaten unpolished or partially polished, and has a red bran layer, rather than the more common pale brown. Red rice has a nutty flavor. It has the highest nutritional value[quantify]among rices eaten with the bran intact.[citation needed]. Some red rice has a low glycemic index. The rice will be slowly digested and energy will be slowly released. This will cause a slower increase in blood sugar levels.[1] Red rice contains high antioxidant levels that reduce free radicals in the organism.[2] It is also a richer source of iron, magnesium, calcium and zinc than white rice.[3]
